You're building a lightweight simulator for one-dimensional motion under constant acceleration. Each step in the simulation is a discrete event, containing position, velocity, and timestamp.

We're giving you a MotionEvent class and a basic simulation runner. Your tasks will involve working with collections of these events using modern C++20 STL techniques, such as std::ranges, algorithms, and lambda expressions.
